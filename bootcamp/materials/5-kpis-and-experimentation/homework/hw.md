# Google Photos' KPI and Experimentation

I have been using Google Photos for over 4 years, starting during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Back then, I had a lot of free time and began exploring my old photos dating back to when I was a baby. Initially, I used my phone's default gallery to browse through them, but I soon encountered some pain points. It was inconvenient to continuously transfer photos and videos from my hard drive to my phone. Additionally, sharing photos with my family required copying them from my hard disk, which was not an efficient process. As a result, I started looking for an app that could alleviate these challenges.

After browsing through a few alternatives, I ultimately chose Google Photos. The reasons for this decision were:

1. Seamless integration with my Google account, which I already use for almost everything.
2. Amazing features like automatic backup, people detection, photo sharing, etc.
3. Competitive pricing.

These three factors made me a loyal Google Photos user. However, I have a few suggestions that might help improve Google Photos' subscription rate. To test these suggestions, I would run the following experiments:

---

## Experiment 1: Enhanced Photo Editing Features

**Objective:** Occasionally, I need to edit my photosâ€”like removing backgrounds, adding text, or applying frames. Currently, Google Photos offers basic editing tools, but for more complex edits, I have to rely on third-party software. I want to test whether adding more advanced photo editing features would attract more users to Google Photos.

- **Null Hypothesis:** Advanced photo editing features do not attract more users.
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** Advanced photo editing features attract more users.
  
**Leading Metric:** Number of active users using the app.
  
**Lagging Metric:** Increase in subscription rate.

**Test Cell Allocation:** 50% of users will have access to the enhanced photo editing features, while the remaining 50% will use the current, basic editing tools.

## Experiment 2: Query-Based Photo Search

**Objective:** Finding specific photos can be challenging, especially when you have a large collection. With advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the possibility of implementing a more effective search query feature has become feasible. I want to test if introducing a query-based photo search feature will increase user engagement.

- **Null Hypothesis:** The query-based photo search feature does not increase user engagement.
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** The query-based photo search feature increases user engagement.

**Leading Metric:** User engagement (e.g., frequency of photo searches, time spent searching).
  
**Lagging Metric:** User subscription rate.

**Test Cell Allocation:** 50% of users will have access to the query-based photo search, while the other 50% will continue using the current photo browsing method.

## Experiment 3: Community Sharing Feature

**Objective:** The ability to share photos is an important feature, and many users enjoy sharing memories with others. Google Photos already allows for sharing among individuals, but I believe a broader community-based sharing feature could be impactful. For example, categorizing photos based on shared events or people and allowing users to explore photos from others in a community could boost engagement. I want to test whether implementing this community feature would drive more users to use Google Photos.

- **Null Hypothesis:** The community sharing feature does not affect user engagement.
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** The community sharing feature increases user engagement.

**Leading Metric:** User engagement (e.g., the number of photos shared and viewed, community interaction).
  
**Lagging Metric:** Subscription rate.

**Test Cell Allocation:** 50% of users will have access to the community sharing feature, while the other 50% will continue using the regular photo sharing features.
